              <p>
                Hi there! My name is Rafael Myauti, im a 19 years old computer engineering student at IFMS - Tr√™s Lagoas located in Brazil.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started my familiarity with technologies since i was a kid, when i got a PlayStation 1 from my uncle that brought it from Japan, since then, i fell into this magical world!
                My experience with PCs started with an old desktop computer from a brazilian trademark called "Positivo", where i used to listen to some music and play Adobe Flash games.
                When i was 15, i had the opportunity to study in a computer technical school, where i learned about programming, office package usage, web developing and some other stuffs from this environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                When i made my first HTML screen, i knew that i was going to fell in love with the web development. Since then, i started to practice a lot, so i could
                get better and do some cool stuffs. When i finished the technical school, i was able to create a fully functional web system, so all this baggage helped me a lot!
                After all this time into the technical school, i decided that i was going to the college to study computer engineering, and here i am! üòÅ

                    This is a project made using NextJS, that consumes github's API and retrieves to the user some informations about the profile searched.
                    The project contains responsiveness, so you can check it on your desktop or in a cellphone!
