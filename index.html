              <h3>About me</h3>
              <p>
                Hi there! My name is Rafael Myauti, I'm a 19 years old computer engineering student at IFMS - Tr√™s Lagoas located in Brazil.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started to become familiar with technologies since I was a kid, when I got a PlayStation 1 from my uncle that brought it from Japan.
                Ever since, I am in love with this world! My experience with PCs started on an old desktop computer from a Brazilian trademark called "Positivo",
                where I used to listen to some music and play Adobe Flash games. 
                When I was 15, I had the opportunity to study in a technical school for computing, where I learned about programming, office package usage, web development and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I made my first HTML screen, I already knew that I was going to fall in love with web development. 
                Since then, I started to practice a lot so I could get better and do some interesting projects. 
                When I finished studying at my technical school, I was able to create a fully functional web system, so all this baggage helped me a lot! 
                After all this time at the technical school, I decided that I was going to college to study computer engineering, and this is where I am now! üòÅ

                <p>
                  This is a project made using NextJS, that consumes github's API and retrieves to the user some information about the profile searched. 
                  The project contains responsiveness, so you can check it on your desktop or with a cellphone!
