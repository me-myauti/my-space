# My portfolio
This is a simple HTML, CSS, JS project that i built as my personal portfolio.
Nothing special in the code itself! I used some flexbox concepts to build the page and the animations came from a JS lib called
[`ScrollReveal`](https://scrollrevealjs.org/)

If you want, fell free to clone this repository and use my stuffs as a base to a better portfolio project! ðŸ™‚

I hope you guys enjoy it!
